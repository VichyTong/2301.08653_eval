Yes, the program has a bug. The bug is in the second for loop where it should be iterating over the counts list instead of the arr list. Here is the corrected code:

def bucketsort(arr, k):
    counts = [0] * k
    for x in arr:
        counts[x] += 1

    sorted_arr = []
    for i, count in enumerate(counts):
        sorted_arr.extend([i] * count)

    return sorted_arr
