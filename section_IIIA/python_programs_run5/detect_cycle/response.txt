Yes, the program has a bug. If the linked list does not have a cycle, the while loop will run indefinitely and the program will not return anything.

To fix it, we can add a condition to check if the hare has reached the end of the linked list (i.e. hare.successor is None) and return False in that case. Here's the updated code:

def detect_cycle(node):
    hare = tortoise = node

    while True:
        if hare.successor is None or hare.successor.successor is None:
            return False

        tortoise = tortoise.successor
        hare = hare.successor.successor

        if hare is tortoise:
            return True

We also need to check if hare.successor is None before accessing hare.successor.successor, otherwise we will get an AttributeError if hare.successor is None.
