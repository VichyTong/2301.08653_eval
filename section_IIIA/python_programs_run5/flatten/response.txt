Yes, this program has a bug. The issue is with the last line of the function. When the function encounters an element that is not a list, it should yield that element, but instead it is yielding the result of calling the flatten function on that element, which will cause an error.

To fix this, change the last line to yield x instead of yield flatten(x):

```
def flatten(arr):
    for x in arr:
        if isinstance(x, list):
            for y in flatten(x):
                yield y
        else:
            yield x
```
