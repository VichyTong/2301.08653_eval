No, this program does not have a bug.

It is a recursive implementation of the quicksort algorithm, which sorts an array by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array into two sub-arrays, one containing elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater than the pivot. The algorithm then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

To use this program, simply call the quicksort function with an array as its argument. For example:

arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
sorted_arr = quicksort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)

This will output the sorted array:

[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 9]
