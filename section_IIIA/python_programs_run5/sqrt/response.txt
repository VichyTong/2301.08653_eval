There is no syntax error in this program, but there is a logical error. The while loop condition should be based on the difference between the square of the approximation and the original number x, not the difference between x and the approximation. 

Here is the corrected code:

def sqrt(x, epsilon):
    approx = x / 2
    while abs(x - approx**2) > epsilon:
        approx = 0.5 * (approx + x / approx)
    return approx

This code will calculate the square root of x with the given epsilon value.
