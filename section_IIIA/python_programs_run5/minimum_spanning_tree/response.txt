It is difficult to determine if this program has a bug without knowing the expected behavior and input/output. However, one potential issue is that the input parameter "weight_by_edge" is not defined in the code snippet provided. 

Assuming that "weight_by_edge" is a dictionary where the keys are edges and the values are weights, the program may have a bug if there are multiple edges with the same weight. In this case, the sorting may not be stable and the output may not be deterministic.

To fix this, we can modify the sorting key to include the edge itself as a tiebreaker:

```
for edge in sorted(weight_by_edge, key=lambda e: (weight_by_edge[e], e)):
```

This will ensure that if two edges have the same weight, they will be sorted based on their identity and the output will be deterministic.
