It is difficult to determine if this program has a bug without more context about what it is supposed to do and what input it is expecting. However, one potential issue is that if the input tokens contain a token that is not an integer or one of the specified operators (+, -, *, /), the program will throw a KeyError when trying to access its precedence in the precedence dictionary.

To fix this, you could add a check to make sure the token is a valid operator before accessing its precedence in the dictionary. For example:

def shunting_yard(tokens):
    precedence = {
        '+': 1,
        '-': 1,
        '*': 2,
        '/': 2
    }

    rpntokens = []
    opstack = []
    for token in tokens:
        if isinstance(token, int):
            rpntokens.append(token)
        elif token in precedence:
            while opstack and precedence[token] <= precedence[opstack[-1]]:
                rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())
            opstack.append(token)
        else:
            # handle invalid token here
            print("Invalid token:", token)

    while opstack:
        rpntokens.append(opstack.pop())

    return rpntokens
