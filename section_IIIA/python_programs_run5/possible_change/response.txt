Yes, this program has a bug. When the function is called recursively with the rest of the coins, it should use the rest variable instead of coins. Here's the corrected code:

def possible_change(coins, total):
    if total == 0:
        return 1
    if total < 0:
        return 0

    first, *rest = coins
    return possible_change(rest, total) + possible_change(coins, total - first)
