The program does not have a syntax error, but it may have a logical error. 

The function is supposed to find the next palindrome number given a list of digits. However, the current implementation may not always produce the correct result. 

For example, if the input is [9, 9, 9], the function will return [1, 0, 0, 1], which is not the next palindrome number. 

To fix the function, we can modify the while loop to handle the carry-over when incrementing the digits. We can also simplify the code by using a for loop instead of a while loop. 

Here's a possible implementation:

def next_palindrome(digit_list):
    n = len(digit_list)
    mid = n // 2
    
    # increment the middle digit(s)
    carry = 1
    for i in range(mid-1, -1, -1):
        if carry == 0:
            break
        digit_list[i] += carry
        carry = digit_list[i] // 10
        digit_list[i] %= 10
        if i != n-i-1:
            digit_list[n-i-1] = digit_list[i]
    
    # handle carry-over to the left side
    if carry > 0:
        digit_list = [1] + [0] * (n-1) + [1]
    return digit_list

With this implementation, the function should correctly find the next palindrome number for any input list of digits.
