Yes, this program has a bug. The function is supposed to reverse a linked list, but it does not update the previous node correctly. The last node of the original linked list becomes the head of the reversed linked list, but the function returns None instead.

To fix it, we need to update the prevnode variable inside the loop and return it at the end of the function:

```
def reverse_linked_list(node):
    prevnode = None
    while node:
        nextnode = node.successor
        node.successor = prevnode
        prevnode = node
        node = nextnode
    return prevnode
``` 

This way, the function correctly reverses the linked list and returns the new head node.
