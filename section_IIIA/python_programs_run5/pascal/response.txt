There is no syntax error in the program, but there is a logical error. The program is not generating the correct Pascal's triangle. 

To fix it, we need to change the condition in the inner loop from `range(0, r)` to `range(r+1)`. This will ensure that we generate the correct number of elements in each row of the triangle. 

Here's the corrected code:

def pascal(n):
    rows = [[1]]
    for r in range(1, n):
        row = []
        for c in range(r+1):
            upleft = rows[r - 1][c - 1] if c > 0 else 0
            upright = rows[r - 1][c] if c < r else 0
            row.append(upleft + upright)
        rows.append(row)

    return rows
