There is no syntax error in this program, but it may not produce the correct output for all inputs. The function is supposed to find the longest common subsequence between two strings, but it does not handle cases where there are multiple longest common subsequences correctly. 

For example, if the inputs are "ABCD" and "ABDC", the function will return "ABC" instead of "ABD". 

To fix this, we can modify the function to return a set of all longest common subsequences instead of just one. We can also add memoization to improve performance for large inputs. 

Here is the modified code:

def longest_common_subsequence(a, b, memo={}):
    if (a, b) in memo:
        return memo[(a, b)]
    
    if not a or not b:
        return set()

    elif a[0] == b[0]:
        result = set([a[0] + s for s in longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b[1:], memo)])
    else:
        result = set()
        for s in longest_common_subsequence(a, b[1:], memo):
            result.add(s)
        for s in longest_common_subsequence(a[1:], b, memo):
            result.add(s)
    
    memo[(a, b)] = result
    return result
