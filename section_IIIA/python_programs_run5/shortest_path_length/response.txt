It is difficult to determine if this program has a bug without additional context or information about its intended functionality. However, there are a few potential issues that could be addressed:

1. The `successors` attribute of the `node` object is not defined in the code provided. This could cause an error when trying to iterate over it in the `for` loop.

2. The `get` function returns 0 if the `wanted_node` is not found in the `node_heap`. This could cause issues if the actual shortest distance is 0, as it would be indistinguishable from a missing node.

3. The `insert_or_update` function does not handle the case where the `node_heap` is empty. This could cause an error when trying to access the first element in the heap.

To fix these issues, the following changes could be made:

1. Define the `successors` attribute for the `node` object, or modify the code to use a different data structure that contains the edges between nodes.

2. Modify the `get` function to return `None` if the `wanted_node` is not found in the `node_heap`, and handle this case appropriately in the `insert_or_update` function.

3. Add a check for an empty `node_heap` at the beginning of the `insert_or_update` function, and handle this case appropriately (e.g. by adding the new node to the heap).
