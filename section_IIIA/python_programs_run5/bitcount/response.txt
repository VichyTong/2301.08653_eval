It is not clear what the intended behavior of this program is, so it is difficult to determine if it has a bug. However, one possible issue is that the function does not handle negative input values. To fix this, you could add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that n is non-negative:

def bitcount(n):
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be non-negative")
    count = 0
    while n:
        n ^= n - 1
        count += 1
    return count
