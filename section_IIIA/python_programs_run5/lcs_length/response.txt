Yes, the program has a bug. The code assumes that dp[i-1, j] exists for all i and j, but this is not true for the first row and column of the dp table. This will result in a KeyError when trying to access dp[i-1, j] for i=0 or j=0.

To fix this, we can initialize the first row and column of the dp table to 0 before starting the loop:

def lcs_length(s, t):
    from collections import Counter

    dp = Counter()

    # Initialize first row and column to 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        dp[i, 0] = 0
    for j in range(len(t)):
        dp[0, j] = 0

    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        for j in range(1, len(t)):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                dp[i, j] = dp[i - 1, j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i, j] = max(dp[i - 1, j], dp[i, j - 1])

    return max(dp.values()) if dp else 0

This should fix the bug and correctly compute the length of the longest common subsequence of s and t.
