It is not clear if the program has a bug without knowing the expected behavior and the input data. However, one potential issue is that the function returns the dictionary `length_by_path` but it is not sorted or filtered in any way. 

To fix this, one could add a sorting step before returning the dictionary, for example:

```
def shortest_path_lengths(n, length_by_edge):
    length_by_path = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))
    length_by_path.update({(i, i): 0 for i in range(n)})
    length_by_path.update(length_by_edge)

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                length_by_path[i, j] = min(
                    length_by_path[i, j],
                    length_by_path[i, k] + length_by_path[j, k]
                )

    return dict(sorted(length_by_path.items()))
```

This sorts the dictionary by its keys and returns a new dictionary. Alternatively, one could filter the dictionary to remove the infinite values or any other undesired values.
