No, this program does not have a bug.

The program recursively finds the prime factors of a given number n and returns them in a list. It first checks if n is equal to 1, in which case it returns an empty list. Then it loops through all numbers from 2 to the square root of n and checks if n is divisible by any of them. If it is, it adds that number to the list of factors and recursively calls the function with the quotient of n divided by that number. If none of the numbers from 2 to the square root of n divide n, it returns an empty list.

To use this function, simply call it with a positive integer as an argument:

```
factors = get_factors(24)
print(factors)  # Output: [2, 2, 2, 3]
```

This will print the prime factors of 24, which are 2, 2, 2, and 3.
